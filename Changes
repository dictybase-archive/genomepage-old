    * Added memcached in production
release-2-19 
    * Fixed incompatibilities with Mojolicious 0.999936
    * Rewrote tests with Test::Mojo
    * Moved fcgi scripts to script folder
    * Moved static content (images, css, js) from public/static to public/static/genomerest
    * Removed duplicated code for verifying species from GenomeREST::Controller::Input. 
      Rerouted matching route to go through the same species validation bridge as 
      GenomeREST::Controller::Genome prior to id validation.
    * Moved templates to epl from TT. 
      Page layouts are located in 'templates/layouts' folder and are shared between all pages 
      (layout renders footer and header based on species provided and loads all js/css needed). 
      Gene page has its own layout because of different order of components required 
      (removed YUI loader for the time being). 
      Removed custom renderers required before for TT templates: 
      - GenomeREST::Renderer::Index
      - GenomeREST::Renderer::JSON 
      - GenomeREST::Renderer::JSON_Generic
      - GenomeREST::Renderer::TT 
    * Removed not used anymore GenomeREST::Helper
